Fine tuning gpt2 for text generation


Fine-Tuning GPT-2 for Contextual Text Generation
🚀 Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning GPT-2, a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI, to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. By training on WikiText-103, the model learns to mimic the style and structure of the dataset, improving its ability to generate meaningful outputs.

📌 Features

Fine-tuned GPT-2 using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch
Generates high-quality, context-aware text completions
Implements sampling techniques (top-k, top-p, temperature) for diverse output
Supports custom datasets for specialized text generation
🛠 Technologies Used

Python 🐍
Transformers (Hugging Face) 🤗
PyTorch 🔥
Tokenization & Preprocessing
📂 Usage
Clone the repository and run the fine-tuning script to train the model on your own dataset. Check out the examples to see how well the model generates structured and relevant text!

💡 Example Prompt & Output
Input:
"The Gregorian Tower (Italian: Torre Gregoriana) or Tower of the Winds (Italian: Torre dei Venti) is a round tower located..."

Generated Output:
"The Gregorian Tower (Italian: Torre Gregoriana) or Tower of the Winds (Italian: Torre dei Venti) is a round tower located in the vicinity of Vatican City. It was first built by Pope Gregory XIII in 1549 and was later extended to the Tower Building on the Vatican Gardens."
